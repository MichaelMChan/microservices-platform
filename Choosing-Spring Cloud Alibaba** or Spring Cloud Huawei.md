Choosing **Spring Cloud Alibaba** or **Spring Cloud Huawei** over directly using **Spring Cloud** is primarily because they offer richer features, better cloud service integration, and solutions that are more aligned with enterprise needs, building on the foundation of Spring Cloud. Below is a detailed analysis of the reasons:
---
### 1. **Limitations of Spring Cloud**
Spring Cloud is an excellent microservices framework, but it has some limitations:
- **Relatively Basic Features**: Spring Cloud provides foundational features such as service registration and discovery (Eureka), configuration management (Spring Cloud Config), load balancing (Ribbon), and circuit breaking (Hystrix). However, it has weaker support for distributed transactions, message queues, and traffic control.
- **Lack of Deep Cloud Service Integration**: Spring Cloud is a general-purpose framework and does not deeply integrate with specific cloud services (e.g., Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud). As a result, additional adaptation layers are needed for cloud-native scenarios.
- **Some Components Are No Longer Maintained**: Certain core components in Spring Cloud Netflix (e.g., Eureka, Hystrix) have been discontinued, forcing enterprises to seek alternatives.

### 5. **Scenarios for Directly Using Spring Cloud**
Although Spring Cloud Alibaba and Spring Cloud Huawei offer more features, directly using Spring Cloud may be more appropriate in the following scenarios:
- **Small Projects**: The project scale is small and does not require complex microservices governance features.
- **Self-Built Infrastructure**: The enterprise has built a robust infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, Istio) and does not rely on cloud providers' managed services.
- **Technology Stack Constraints**: The team is more familiar with Spring Cloud and does not want to introduce additional learning costs.
---
### 6. **Conclusion**
Choosing **Spring Cloud Alibaba** or **Spring Cloud Huawei** over directly using **Spring Cloud** is mainly because they offer advantages in terms of features, cloud service integration, and enterprise support:
- **Spring Cloud Alibaba** provides comprehensive microservices governance capabilities and multi-cloud compatibility, making it suitable for enterprises needing powerful features and flexibility.
- **Spring Cloud Huawei** deeply integrates with Huawei Cloud, offering enterprise-level support and high availability, making it ideal for Huawei Cloud users.
If your business requires stronger microservices governance capabilities, deep cloud service integration, or enterprise-level support, **Spring Cloud Alibaba** or **Spring Cloud Huawei** is recommended. If the project is small-scale or your infrastructure is well-established, directly using **Spring Cloud** is also a viable option.
